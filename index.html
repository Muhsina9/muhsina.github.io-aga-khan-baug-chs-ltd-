    <h2>About Aga Khan Baug</h2>

    <p class="since">Established in <strong>19XX</strong></p>

    <hr class="divider">

    <p>
      Aga Khan Baug Housing Society has been a peaceful residential community
      rooted in cooperation, mutual respect, and shared responsibility.
      Over the years, the society has grown into a close-knit neighborhood
      that values transparency, safety, and togetherness.
    </p>

    <p>
      Managed by an elected committee and supported by its residents,
      the society continues to preserve its legacy while adapting
      thoughtfully to modern needs.
