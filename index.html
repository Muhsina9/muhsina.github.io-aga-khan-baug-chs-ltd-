  <p>
    His Late Highness Aga Khan IV profound pleasure to return to Versova
    to formally open the Aga Khan Baug housing project, a development conceived
    to restore dignity, stability, and hope to families facing urban poverty.
  </p>

  <p>
    Declaring the housing ready to receive its first residents, he described
    the project as more than a construction milestone — it was a social
    foundation intended to uplift generations through secure housing, improved
    health, and access to education.
  </p>

  <p>
    Emphasising the responsibility of the fortunate to ignite the “spark of
    human endeavour,” the Aga Khan spoke of housing as the first ingredient of
    self-respect, capable of transforming family life, work ethic, and future
    opportunity.
